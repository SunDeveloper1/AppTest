I still consider myself a student with an open mind, ready to explore and find effective solutions to problems. My recent transition towards Full Stack shows my commitment to continuous growth and my dedication toward meaningful contributions to projects and teams. I am a quick learner who can make adjustments to the ways of working to foster efficiency and fellowship. I always try to learn from my seniors and seek guidance from them from time to time. Always try to complete the stories in time with positive impacts and outcomes.
